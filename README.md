# Struct Inheritance
This is a sample implementation of Struct Inheritance using composition over inheritance in Solidity. 
This technique is implemented for mapping types, dynamic array types in storage mode, and type-casting in memory. 
It is compatible with Solidity compiler versions ^0.7.0 and ^0.8.0.
